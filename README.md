# All thanks to Jim for allowing me to upload this!
Thank you, Jim from r/techsupport, for allowing me to upload the following code here. Do note that this was made in a afternoon, so it will look ugly.

But it works, so we don't care.

# What does this code do?
This code is a quick MCE analysis tool. Instead of going through lookup tables and whatnot through official AMD and Intel documentation, this allows users to input code quickly and easily and figure out what part of the CPU, RAM or motherboard is messing up.
